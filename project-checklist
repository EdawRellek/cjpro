Here is a list of TO DO's that I will be adding to and hopefully checking off in order to keep track of what needs to be done and what I still have left to do.



1.(COMPLETED -  Removed and added to junk-remove.php line 322 if needed in future)  Test if I still need to use the .cj-pro-get-products-form ajax call (line 167 cjpro.js)
    --Commented out code in file to test.  Looks like this code was used in previous version and I forgot to take it out!  Oops! ;)
    
2.(COMPLETED)  Add the sort option of default currency code to either the API call made to Commission Junction (if possible this is the best scenario) OR add to existing SQL statements that pull data from database.
    *****Moving Currency selector from Options page to the "Create Campaign" page for greater flexibilty.
    *****Added CURRENCY variable to API GET URL to limit results through API 

3.  (COMPLETED) If using WooCommerce to dispaly products I need to display the "Product" Categories instead of "Post" categories in (cj-create.php & cj-display-products.php)

4. (COMPLETED) Set Api Call timeout.
    added set_time_limit(60); to cj-results script.  Initial test corrected problem of script not finishing and changing the button & products found variables on display.php
    ****Need to test further to verifiy if it was  set_time_limit(60); that corrected the issue or another factor
    
5. Research various image file types to set up as many rules to alter their URL and sideload them into Wordpress if initial image file extension is either too small or not ending in .jpg/png

6. (COMPLETED) Fix Issue with wrong Author ID being stored in categories database when creating campaign
    **** removed stripslashes & strip_tags .... already using sanitize_text_field

7. Move Default sort_by and sort_order from Options to store in Category DB 
    If so it removes hidden fields from Options page

8.  Cron job Set Up
    - Make sure post status is set to default if Cron Is being used.  If checkbox on Options page is set set default post status to 'pending'/draft
    - Create Cron Schedule For each campaign that creates a unique timeframe.
    - Create Cron Event for each campaign 
    - Create function that executes changing the post status when cron fires
    - Create function that removes cron event and cron schedule (if not being used by another campaign) when user changes the timeframe of when the cron fires
    - Create function that removes all cron scheules and events when plugin is deactivated.
