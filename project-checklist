Here is a list of TO DO's that I will be adding to and hopefully checking off in order to keep track of what needs to be done and what I still have left to do.



1.(COMPLETED -  Removed and added to junk-remove.php line 322 if needed in future)  Test if I still need to use the .cj-pro-get-products-form ajax call (line 167 cjpro.js)
    --Commented out code in file to test.  Looks like this code was used in previous version and I forgot to take it out!  Oops! ;)
    
2.(COMPLETED)  Add the sort option of default currency code to either the API call made to Commission Junction (if possible this is the best scenario) OR add to existing SQL statements that pull data from database.
    *****Moving Currency selector from Options page to the "Create Campaign" page for greater flexibilty.
    *****Added CURRENCY variable to API GET URL to limit results through API 

3.  (COMPLETED) If using WooCommerce to dispaly products I need to display the "Product" Categories instead of "Post" categories in (cj-create.php & cj-display-products.php)

4. (COMPLETED) Set Api Call timeout.
    added set_time_limit(60); to cj-results script.  Initial test corrected problem of script not finishing and changing the button & products found variables on display.php
    ****Need to test further to verifiy if it was  set_time_limit(60); that corrected the issue or another factor
    
5. Research various image file types to set up as many rules to alter their URL and sideload them into Wordpress if initial image file extension is either too small or not ending in .jpg/png

    **** removed stripslashes & strip_tags .... already using sanitize_text_field

    -(COMPLETED) Section created on single-display.php page

    -(COMPLETED) Input data used to control this function is serialized and store in campaigns db
    - (COMPLETED)Pulls in test link and after user determines what method to use to try and enlarge the image it provides a test link where the user can verify that their input has sucessfully changed the image size.
    - (COMPLETED)Add button to then update all the images.

    - (POSTPONED INDEFINETLY)Images currently stored in two seperate columns.  Find way to combine into single column in an array             under cj_img_url db column?
       
    
    -(COMPLETED) How to confirm if new images are set?  If count array = 2 then new image has been added and to use that one. 
     GET cj_img_update for sku
        if(cj_img_update != 'delete' || cj_img_update != ''){
            $new_img_url = 
    - (COMPLETED)This keeps original image url intact in case user want to delete all new iamges in case of error
